You can pick a good Zen quote of the day to run with.</p><ul><li>When you realize nothing is lacking, the whole world belongs to you. - <i>Lao Tzu</i></li><li>The noble-minded are calm and steady. Little people are forever fussing and fretting. -<i> Confucius</i></li><li>Education breeds confidence. Confidence breeds hope. Hope breeds peace.<i> - Confucius</i></li><li>I discovered that it is necessary, absolutely necessary, to believe in nothing. That is, we have to believe in something which has no form and no color--something which exists before all forms and colors appear... No matter what god or doctrine you believe in, if you become attached to it, your belief will be based more or less on a self-centered idea.<i> ― Shunryu Suzuki</i></li><li>Zen is a liberation from time. For if we open our eyes and see clearly; it becomes obvious that there is no other time than this instant, and that the past and the future are abstractions without any concrete reality. <i>- Alan Watts</i></li><li>Learning to let go should be learned before learning to get. Life should be touched, not strangled. You’ve got to relax, let it happen at times, and at others move forward with it. ― <i>Ray Bradbury</i></li><li>Wise men don’t judge – they seek to understand.<i> - Wei Wu Wei</i></li><li>The place to improve the world is first in one’s own heart and head and hands. - <i>Robert M. Pirsig</i></li><li>Craziness is good. Crazy people are happy, free; they have no hindrance. But since you have many attachments, you are only a little crazy. This is not crazy enough.

When thoughts vanish, then do all things vanish. - <i>Huang Po</i></li><li>Many have died; you also will die. The drum of death is being beaten. The world has fallen in love with a dream. Only sayings of the wise will remain. -<i> Kabir</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bffc95a37314e9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best Uncle Iroh quotes from Avatar: The Last Airbender</span></p></a><h2>Zen proverbs that will blow your mind</h2><p class=align-left>Every community needs to believe in something or follow a certain philosophy or set of beliefs to thrive.

No one is ever more him/herself than when they really laugh. Their defenses are down. It's very Zen-like that moment. They are completely open, completely themselves when that message hits the brain, and the laugh begins. That's when new ideas can be implanted. If a new idea slips in at that moment, it has a chance to grow<i>. ― George Carlin</i></li><li>When we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways – either by losing hope and falling into self-destructive habits or by using the challenge to find our inner strength. Thanks to the teachings of Buddha, I have been able to take this second way. ―<i> Dalai Lama</i></li><li>Learn to be comfortable in adversity, but most importantly, learn to be comfortable when you’re bored.<i> - Maxime Lagacé</i></li><li>What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.<i> - Confucius</i></li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a7e0c5d7f2aa8d88.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cool Walt Whitman quotes on love, nature and the meaning of life</span></p></a><h2>Zen quotes on life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8f868f579a528c07_w.png><p class=align-left>Like it is with several beliefs and philosophies, including religious ones, most people will vouch for what they choose to follow.

The mind is everything. What we think we become. ― <i>Buddha</i></li><li>The less you try to impress, the more peaceful you can be.<i> - Maxime Lagacé</i></li><li>When it is understood that one loses joy and happiness in the attempt to possess them, the essence of natural farming will be realized. The ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings. ― <i>Masanobu Fukuoka</i></li><li>Silence is the language of Om. We need silence to be able to reach our Self. Both internal and external silence is very important to feel the presence of that supreme Love. ― <i>Amit Ray</i></li><li>When we start to feel anxious or depressed, instead of asking, “What do I need to get to be happy?” The question becomes, “What am I doing to disturb the inner peace that I already have?”. - <i>D.T. Suzuki</i></li><li>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle, and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow, or it can crash.
