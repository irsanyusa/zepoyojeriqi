I had thought that Sweden was bad, but Sweden hasn’t gone near to the depths of various sex deviations and obsessions that we have gone. I suppose there are sections of this country that have sunk as low as anything in history, because in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah and Pompeii and Rome they didn’t have the presses or the motion pictures to stimulate all of this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dangers of Censorship</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">No nation in history has ever been able to go in this direction and survive very long. I think that the greatest threat to our democracy is moral decadence. And I do not think it represents the majority of the American people. I know many of the members of the Supreme Court, and I don’t think they ever meant that their rulings would bring about this avalanche of filth and dirt that is greater than anything in the history of the world. And I think that the Supreme Court is going to have to go back and study this situation and clarify their position. I think censorship is a very dangerous thing. But I think we should have some rules where we draw the line on obscenity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">God never meant that people were to wear clothes. He meant we were to be nude. But we were in a state of innocence. Then sin came into the human race and became a blood poisoning. The first thing that Adam and Eve did after their rebellion against God was to see themselves naked, and they were ashamed, and they sewed fig leaves and clothed themselves. The whole Biblical teaching since then is that people are to dress in modesty. Now that doesn’t mean that girls are to wear their dresses down to their ankles. Certainly a woman should never disguise the fact that she is a woman. A woman’s body is very beautiful. But this emphasis on nudity, which stimulates sensuality—this is what is going to destroy any society.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Dangers of Sexuality</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s interesting to me that in the Soviet Union, Cuba and China, they’re trying to build a strong society, a revolutionary society that they hope will ultimately conquer the world. But they don’t allow this kind of sexuality. They came to the conclusion that this is a destructive force. I don’t think the function of the playwright, the author, the artist, is to reflect what’s going on, any more than I should reflect what’s going on. I think their function ought to be to lead, to direct.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I was 17, 18, 19, 20, I was interested in sex—and if I had had all of this thrown at me at that time, I don’t know whether or not I could have withstood it. I think about my own sons and my own daughters, and I’m sure that many parents are concerned about what their children are exposed to. Human nature is so built that it cannot resist these temptations when they are thrown from every angle.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, sex is a gift from God. We went tpo far in the Victorian period. We hushed it up. It should never have been suppressed. It’s something that God gave us. We should talk about it. It shouldn’t be in the back alleys in the dirt and trash. Young people are getting the wrong idea about sex. Within marriage it’s the most wonderful of relationships. It’s more than a propagation of the race. This is where I disagree with the Pope. Sex is more than just to produce children. Sex is for enjoyment within the confines of marriage. Sex is also for the fulfillment of a couple. It’s the ultimate in fulfillment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Fornication, Adultery</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The thing that alarms me is that there are so many clergymen who say that the so-called “new morality” is all right. They say we’re living in a new generation; let’s be relevant, let’s change God’s law. Let’s say that adultery is all right under certain circumstances; fornication’s all right under certain circumstances. If it’s “meaningful.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Bible says the reason that the flood came was that lawlessness had spread all over the world and sensuality had spread all over the world. Jesus said, “As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be when the Son of Man comes back.” He said there would be a worldwide rebellion. Well, we see that going on now. He said that there would be an obsession with sex at the end of history, and we see all of that going on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The literature is unbelievable. And the underground newspapers with their filthy names and titles and want ads. You see, there’s no love in this sort of thing. We’re just buying sex like you would buy a piece of meat. Eventually this decadence will destroy us, and that’s why I’m asking people to commit themselves to a Christ who’s teaching love and understanding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tbG9gbn5wuc6dnKumXaG2t7XNoGSboZyhxm6z0ZqfmqVdqbWmedKimqSmlajAbrvFZqqonJ%2BifA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmodern-living-billy-graham-the-sickness-of-sodom.html&text=Modern%20Living%3a%20BILLY%20GRAHAM%3a%20THE%20SICKNESS%20OF%20SODOM&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmodern-living-billy-graham-the-sickness-of-sodom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmodern-living-billy-graham-the-sickness-of-sodom.html&title=Modern%20Living%3a%20BILLY%20GRAHAM%3a%20THE%20SICKNESS%20OF%20SODOM" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmodern-living-billy-graham-the-sickness-of-sodom.html&title=Modern%20Living%3a%20BILLY%20GRAHAM%3a%20THE%20SICKNESS%20OF%20SODOM" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmodern-living-billy-graham-the-sickness-of-sodom.html&title=Modern%20Living%3a%20BILLY%20GRAHAM%3a%20THE%20SICKNESS%20OF%20SODOM" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmodern-living-billy-graham-the-sickness-of-sodom.html&description=Modern%20Living%3a%20BILLY%20GRAHAM%3a%20THE%20SICKNESS%20OF%20SODOM" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reality-check-summer-wont-save-box-office-deadpool-inside-out-twisters-1236092134.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reality Check: Summer Hot Streak Wont Dig U.S. Box Office Out of Deep Hole in 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./batiments-religieux-construits-apres-1905-les-collectivites-vont-pouvoir-subventionner-des-travaux.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="les collectivits vont pouvoir subventionner des travaux de rnovation nergtique">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
