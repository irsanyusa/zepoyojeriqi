Where you lay your head in bed can play an important role in keeping your neck pain-free at night, and fluffy pillows, despite their reputation for comfort, may not always be the best fit.</p><p>“The best way to avoid neck pain is to choose a pillow that keeps your head in a neutral position throughout the night,” says Byron Golub, vice president of product and merchandising at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saatva</a>. “Too thin, and your head will drop toward the mattress, bending your neck and causing stress on muscles, nerves, and tendons—a recipe for waking up with neck or back pain, tingling arms or legs, or even developing sciatica.” And, he says, the opposite is also true. “If a pillow is too high, it causes the neck to flex forward and the head to be pulled out of alignment.”</p><h2 class="wrapper__Title-sc-13b4pd2-1 eyKiaM summary-title">Our top 3 picks</h2><p>Before you shop, consider the many aspects that make up a good pillow.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-a-pillow-for-neck-pain>How to choose a pillow for neck pain</h2><p>Neck pain is a common complaint among Americans–in fact, <a rel=nofollow href=#>up to 20%</a> of the people around you are dealing with it. While neck pain isn’t always caused directly by pillows, an uncomfortable pillow may not help with good rest if you have neck pain.</p><p>“Root causes of neck pain are 99.9% of the time generally related to a combination of lifestyle factors like stress, injury, diet, etc. versus their relationship to pillows,” says Tawny Kross, CEO, pain specialist and doctor of physical therapy at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kross Centered Care</a>. “However, if someone has neck pain, pillows that encourage neutral alignment (like a contour pillow) can be helpful and less aggravating to the neck.”</p><p>Below are some of the things you should think about when choosing a pillow:</p><h3>Loft</h3><p>The loft is the compressed height of the pillow when you lay down on it. Usually, <a rel=alternate href=#>pillows</a> come in low, medium, or high loft.</p><p>Each pillow <a rel=alternate href=#>loft differs</a> by inches:</p><ul><li>Low: Up to three inches thick</li><li>Medium: Between three and five inches thick</li><li>High: Five or more inches thick</li></ul><h3>Firmness level</h3><p>This level will depend on what your pillow is made of—down feathers will feel less firm than dense foam, for example. Dr. Kross shares that a “semi-firm” pillow may be a good choice for sleepers. should check your mattress, though,, because its density may impact how your pillow lays on it.</p><h3>Materials and type</h3><p>The common materials that make up pillows may include synthetic fill, organic cotton, feathers, foam, or memory foam. The type of pillow you buy will likely influence your sleep comfort. An orthopedic pillow may be helpful if you suffer from neck pain, according to some <a rel=nofollow href=#>studies</a>, as listed in the National Institute of Health’s library. However, other studies, like one carried out at <a rel=nofollow href=#>McMaster University</a> in Hamilton, Ontario in Canada, have found inadequate data as to the nature of the improved quality of sleep based solely on a pillow. Whatever you decide to do, a comfortable pillow will likely not detract from getting a good night’s rest.</p><h3>Your sleep position</h3><p>The position of your body in bed, whether you’re a side, back, or stomach sleeper, will usually play a part in finding the right pillow for avoiding neck pain. “For a restful night's sleep and to reduce the risk of waking up with neck pain, it’s essential for sleepers to select a pillow that accommodates their preferred sleep position (back, side, or stomach) and maintains correct spinal alignment,” shares Martin Seeley, founder & CEO at Mattress Next Day.</p><h3>Body type</h3><p>Although not as crucial as your sleeping position, your body type is a factor when choosing a pillow. According to Seeley, “Generally, people with smaller bodies need a low-loft pillow, those with medium builds need a medium-loft pillow, and people with larger builds need a high-loft pillow.”</p><p>Of course, there are always exceptions to these, depending on how you sleep. Trying out different loft heights may be a way of finding your perfect pillow to avoid neck pain.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-pillows-for-neck-pain>Our top picks for the best pillows for neck pain</h2><h3>Best value pillow for neck pain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>EPABO Contour Memory Foam Pillow</a></h3><p>This pillow is made from neck-friendly memory foam and was specifically created to reduce neck pain.

Designed to restore the curve of your neck while sleeping, this probably isn’t a pillow your kids or partner will want to cuddle up with, but if you suffer from pain and don’t mind an extremely firm surface, it’s worth asking your doctor about it.</p><p>An important point worth noting, though, is that the company specifically states that your body “may need time to adjust to a corrective pillow,” and you can run the risk of increased pain as your body adjusts to it. Be sure to read Therapeutica’s sizing guide (there are four sizes available) and take advantage of its videos on proper sizing to select the best and correct size pillow for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: Foam</li><li>Outer cover material: N/A–machine washable</li><li>Firmness level: Extremely firm</li><li>Available sizes: Four (average, large, petite, and extra-large)</li><li>Price on publish: $104.11</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Designed specifically for helping with neck pain</li><li>In-depth Q&A about the product online</li><li>In-depth information provide by company about sizing and how to measure for your size</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>May cause some pain during your adjustment period</li><li>Extremely firm</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best cervical pillow for neck pain</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Therapeutica Cervical Orthopedic Foam Sleeping Pillow; For Neck, Shoulder, and Back Pain Relief; Helps Spinal Alignment; Back and Side Sleeping, Firm - Average</h3></p><h3>Best firm down pillow for neck pain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Parachute Down Pillow</a></h3><p>If you love a firm down pillow but want to make sure your neck is protected, Parachute offers this down in four versions for various sleep positions, including back and <a rel=alternate href=#>side sleepers</a>.

The TRTL travel pillow is specifically designed to support your neck, head and spine when you have to sleep sitting up. It may look more like a scarf than a pillow, but this is no gimmick, and with over 10,000 five-star reviews, it’s definitely worth giving a try on your next vacation.</p><p>What helps it stand head and shoulders (pardon the pun) above the rest is its ergonomic position (holding you into a comfortable position) that takes into account your neck shape, jaw and shoulder, versus the traditional U-shaped travel pillow.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill material: N/A</li><li>Outer cover material: Machine washable, super-soft, hypoallergenic fabric</li><li>Firmness level: N/A</li><li>Available sizes: One size</li><li>Price on publish: $44.99</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Relieves stress on spine</li><li>Can easily wrap and wear</li><li>Lightweight material</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>If you don’t like things around your neck, this probably isn’t for you</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best pillow for neck support during travel</span></p><p><h3 class=title>TRTL Travel Pillow</h3></p><h3>Best adjustable pillow for neck pain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Marlow Pillow</a></h3><p>The Marlow is (NASA) engineered to help prevent neck and back pain with its balance of memory foam and microfiber.

You’ll also want to avoid placing your pillow too low–you don’t want it underneath your shoulders, because this can also lead to pain, according to Golub.</p><h3>What pillow loft works best for sleepers with neck pain?</h3><p>The best loft for sleepers with neck pain depends on their sleeping position. In most cases, although each individual’s sleep style, pain management, and threshold is unique, a firmer, flatter pillow that allows spine alignment is a good choice overall, according to findings from an article published by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Harvard Medical School’s Harvard Health Publishing</a>.</p><p>Kross says a higher loft may contribute to an uncomfortable sleep. “The compressed height of the pillow can add to discomfort–extreme positions of neck height can be aggravating and create muscle strain,” she adds.</p><h3>How often should you replace your pillow?</h3><p>According to sleep and bedding experts, it’s essential to <a rel=alternate href=#>replace your pillows</a> frequently (every one to two years), as pillows lose their support over time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loJ65rbvWrGSfp6Jiu6avymanmqGeZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-pillows-for-neck-pain.html&text=Best%20Pillows%20for%20Neck%20Pain%20and%20a%20Better%20Nights%20Sleep%2c%20According%20to%20Experts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-pillows-for-neck-pain.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-pillows-for-neck-pain.html&title=Best%20Pillows%20for%20Neck%20Pain%20and%20a%20Better%20Nights%20Sleep%2c%20According%20to%20Experts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-pillows-for-neck-pain.html&title=Best%20Pillows%20for%20Neck%20Pain%20and%20a%20Better%20Nights%20Sleep%2c%20According%20to%20Experts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-pillows-for-neck-pain.html&title=Best%20Pillows%20for%20Neck%20Pain%20and%20a%20Better%20Nights%20Sleep%2c%20According%20to%20Experts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-pillows-for-neck-pain.html&description=Best%20Pillows%20for%20Neck%20Pain%20and%20a%20Better%20Nights%20Sleep%2c%20According%20to%20Experts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./christopher-nolan-oppenheimer-pay-1235938430.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Christopher Nolans Final Oppenheimer Payday Close to $100 Million (EXCLUSIVE)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./movie-theater-chain-bans-whips-for-50-shades-of-grey-premiere.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="AMC Bans Weapons and Props From '50 Shades of Grey' Premiere">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
