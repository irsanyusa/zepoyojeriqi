She's good. She knows the office. And she knows Kimba Wood — she's familiar with the judge."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Hendon first emerged on the scene last week when she argued before the US Southern District Court of New York on behalf of the president, seeking to have her client <a href=# id=8b510fbc-d068-5596-a577-de9f27c3b03a>win the ability to review</a> the documents seized in the FBI raid on Cohen's home, office, and hotel room and determine what fell under attorney-client privilege.</p><p>A former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York, <a href=# id=9e732067-8134-554f-9dc8-3842ecbd5656>Hendon is a partner</a> at Spears & Imes, a boutique firm focusing on white-collar criminal defense and civil litigation that has a staff of just 14 attorneys, according to its website.</p><p>The firm <a href=# id=372da887-c54f-5e2a-8f53-f4d76f6bbf32>is highly regarded</a>, being recognized by JD Journal as one of the top boutique firms in New York City.</p><p>"It would be a lot harder for Trump to have a lawyer representing him from a big firm, because most big firms, most large firms are not going to want to potentially alienate their client base by representing someone as controversial as Trump," the former colleague of Hendon's said.</p><p>Mitchell Epner, a former assistant US attorney for the District of New Jersey and an attorney at Rottenberg Lipman Rich, told Business Insider the firm was "a brand name" among white-collar boutiques.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"There are a few brand names — they are one of them," he said.</p><p>Hendon's partners, David Spears and Linda Imes, are former federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York as well. Last May, following Trump's surprise firing of James Comey as FBI director, <a href=# id=97fa08ec-c252-59a0-8d6c-ae4f3dffed3f>the two were among 180 former prosecutors</a> from the district who signed a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein calling for the appointment of a special counsel. Rosenstein would soon appoint Robert Mueller to that role, and it was a referral from Mueller to the US attorney's office that led to the Cohen raids earlier this month.</p><p>Hendon was not a signatory of the letter.</p><p>David Koenigsberg, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York who previously practiced with Spears and who knows Imes, said he was "somewhat surprised" to see Hendon representing Trump.</p><p>"But I think she's obviously a very, very good lawyer," said Koenigsberg, who is a partner at Menz Bonner Komar & Koenigsberg. "I was obviously thinking, 'Why in this environment would you want to take on Trump as your client?' But when you do criminal law, your clients obviously are not always going to be the most popular people in the world. I admire her professionalism, and there is an argument to be made from the civil-liberties side that maybe the government is overstepping and he's entitled like anybody to a vigorous defense."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Former colleagues made mention of her "strong reputation" and her respected status among alumni of the US attorney's office for the Southern District of New York.</p><p>Steven Feldman, a former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of New York who is a member of the New York State Bar Association's White Collar Committee, which Hendon cochairs, called Hendon a "fantastic pick" for Trump who is "an all-around superstar" in the "upper echelon" of white-collar defense attorneys in the city.</p><p>"Obviously, you read the papers," Koenigsberg said. "Make sure you get your money up front from him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwvM6loK2hk6h6tbTOrJxmr5ikeqy6zrBkraqlor20ec2erp6rpGK5osPYnqlmmaKaerTB0ampoquVmXq1u4ysnJ5lmJq%2FbsDHnqmeZZKqwW7Ax6KlpGebn4F3vdWt</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpolitics-those-who-know-trumps-newest-lawyer-are-surprised-to-see-her-there-but-think.html&text=Those%20who%20know%20Trump%27s%20newest%20lawyer%20are%20surprised%20to%20see%20her%20there%20%20but%20think%20she%27s%20up%20to%20the%20ta&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpolitics-those-who-know-trumps-newest-lawyer-are-surprised-to-see-her-there-but-think.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpolitics-those-who-know-trumps-newest-lawyer-are-surprised-to-see-her-there-but-think.html&title=Those%20who%20know%20Trump%27s%20newest%20lawyer%20are%20surprised%20to%20see%20her%20there%20%20but%20think%20she%27s%20up%20to%20the%20ta" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpolitics-those-who-know-trumps-newest-lawyer-are-surprised-to-see-her-there-but-think.html&title=Those%20who%20know%20Trump%27s%20newest%20lawyer%20are%20surprised%20to%20see%20her%20there%20%20but%20think%20she%27s%20up%20to%20the%20ta" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpolitics-those-who-know-trumps-newest-lawyer-are-surprised-to-see-her-there-but-think.html&title=Those%20who%20know%20Trump%27s%20newest%20lawyer%20are%20surprised%20to%20see%20her%20there%20%20but%20think%20she%27s%20up%20to%20the%20ta" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpolitics-those-who-know-trumps-newest-lawyer-are-surprised-to-see-her-there-but-think.html&description=Those%20who%20know%20Trump%27s%20newest%20lawyer%20are%20surprised%20to%20see%20her%20there%20%20but%20think%20she%27s%20up%20to%20the%20ta" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./trente-mille-mallettes-pour-renforcer-la-bientraitance.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Trente mille mallettes pour renforcer la bientraitance">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-average-household-income-in-the-30-biggest-us-cities-ranked.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The average household income in the 30 biggest US cities, ranked">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
