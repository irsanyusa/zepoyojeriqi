So to help you see which, if any, make sense for you, we've broken down the biggest live-TV streaming services you can choose from today: <a href=# id=0719a976-c52e-52f0-8688-120b8371f9b8>PlayStation Vue</a>, <a href=# id=b9a8dbf6-c597-5d0f-8647-28d517de122f>Sling TV</a>, <a href=# id=6746e3b1-d07b-5d12-84e0-c68f6fc15b2e>DirecTV Now</a>, <a href=# id=84300cca-a919-5399-a7cd-a9d8cabad605>YouTube TV</a>, and <a href=# id=a8fede9f-4bb2-5b7f-8004-b983787ba384>Hulu with Live TV</a>, as well as a smaller offering called <a href=# id=31413d7d-c5a7-561a-9989-e4d04c036cb9>Fubo TV</a> that's expanded in recent months.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Let's dig into the fine print:</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-7>1. How much does it cost?</h3></p><p>It's $20 a month for the base Sling Orange package or $25 a month for a Sling Blue package with more channels.</p><p>For $40 a month, you can buy the Orange and Blue packages together, but the two do not totally overlap in terms of channel selection. (Hold that thought.)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>From there, you can tack on a bunch of smaller specialized bundles of channels for between $5 and $15 a month per bundle. There are way too many to list here, so you should have a look at <a href=# id=096a56b3-6be7-59a3-a329-6f3e9880a0cd>Sling's service page</a>.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-11>2. How many channels does it have?</h3></p><p>Sling Orange has about 30 channels. Sling Blue has about 45 channels depending on where you live, but its lineup doesn't include everything in Sling Orange.</p><p>The add-on bundles can incorporate a few dozen more channels, but those vary wildly in terms of popularity. The likes of MTV, Starz, and Showtime are very popular; other networks, like the Outdoor Channel, are more niche.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>3. Which major channels are</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>CBS is absent. ABC is there, but only for some markets, and only with a Sling Orange subscription. It also costs an extra $5 a month. For the kids, the main Nickelodeon channel isn't available either.</p><p>Also, while Sling does carry Fox and NBC channels, they're included only in the Sling Blue package. And there's a good chance those local channels won't even be available if you don't live in one of a few major markets. Check your coverage before you buy.</p><p>Sling TV (continued)</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-18>4. Does it include ESPN?</h3></p><p>Yes, but like every other Disney-owned channel, it's only in Sling Orange. There, you get ESPN, ESPN 2, and ESPN 3 by default. This is the main thing that keeps the Orange and Blue packages from overlapping.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>5. What about local sports and non-ESPN sports networks?</h3></p><p>This is a little convoluted.</p><p>Sling Blue doesn't have ESPN, but it does include Fox and Comcast/NBC regional sports channels. Again, those vary by region — you can use the tool on <a href=# id=db7d8582-5983-5369-af45-1e654e92f1c5>Dish's FAQ page</a> to check what's covered in your area.</p><p>As for other national sports channels, only Sling Blue includes Fox Sports 1, NFL Network, and NBC Sports Network. With Sling Blue, you can add a Sports Extra package that includes the NFL's RedZone channel, NBA TV, NHL Network, and others for $10 a month.</p><p>If you have Sling Orange, though, that Sports Extra package costs $5 a month, doesn't include NFL RedZone, and throws in a few more deep-in-the-weeds sports channels. Again, that's in addition to the main ESPN networks, which Sling Blue does not have.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can probably see why these services aren't quite revolutionary now.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-26>6. What about HBO?</h3></p><p>HBO is available as an add-on to one of the core bundles. It costs $15 a month, the same as the standalone HBO Now streaming service.</p><p>Sling TV (continued)</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-29>7. Which devices does it support?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can check <a href=# id=3848a5e5-9e9d-5e04-b154-8125995de5cc>Sling's support page</a> for the full list, but the only big no-show is Sony's PlayStation 4.</p><p>Otherwise, Roku, Apple TV (fourth gen), Amazon Fire TV, Chromecast, iOS, Android, Android TV, Windows, macOS, Xbox One, and others are all supported.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-32>8. Does it have DVR so I can record shows I missed?</h3></p><p>Yes, but it doesn't come included with a basic subscription. Instead, you have to pay an extra $5 a month for up to 50 hours of DVR storage.</p><p>Beyond that, a decent chunk of channels — namely Disney's and ESPN's networks — cannot be recorded for the time being. (<a href=# id=07e96743-5fe2-5682-9059-cba47d9e9a66>Here's a full list</a>.) And while Fox networks can be recorded, you'll automatically be reverted to the on-demand version of those shows if they're available. That means you'll have to watch ads.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Sling has done well to roll out DVR support to more devices over the past few months, but Apple's macOS is still out of luck. There's no limit on how long you can keep a recording, though, and Sling <a href=# id=9480db35-4361-5846-9c32-f25f48a3374f>now lets you</a> "protect" specific recordings in case you run out of space.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-36>9. Can I pause and rewind live TV?</h3></p><p>Technically, yes. But several channels — including ESPN, CNN, TBS, Cartoon Network, and AMC — do not support the feature and can only be watched live.</p><p>These channels typically lack support for Sling's replay feature, in which certain recently aired programs are available to stream for a limited time after they first air.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-39>10. How many people can use it at once?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>With Sling Orange, you can only have one active stream going at a time. With Sling Blue, that's bumped up to three concurrent streams. With the $40-a-month Orange-plus-Blue combo package, it becomes four.</p><p>Sling TV (continued)</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-42>11. Any other extras I should know about?</h3></p><p>Sling TV is particularly stacked with bundles of foreign-language channels. Those cost a few bucks extra each month, but if you live a multilingual household, you may find one worthwhile.</p><p>Sling has also undergone a big rebranding effort in recent months. Now, it advertises itself as providing "a la carte TV." This is misleading: A true a la carte service lets you pick and choose which channels you want on an individual basis. Sling TV, like every other live-TV service in America, does not do that. It still saddles you with networks you may never watch.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Still, Sling is at least getting at the big difference between it and its peers: flexibility. Yes, navigating the nitpicky differences between its bundles is a headache, but Sling TV is by far the most malleable when it comes to deciding what kind of bundles you want to include. It is by far the most affordable service as a result. According <a href=# id=957735d0-b8d5-572a-9709-494c7741bff7>to reports</a>, it's the most popular one as well.</p><p>PlayStation Vue</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-47>1. How much does it cost?</h3></p><p>Vue's entry-level Access <a href=# id=0d6ef831-6718-5fee-bb23-187ec5fd2749>package costs</a> $40 a month. Tiered packages with more channels go for $45, $55, and $75 a month.</p><p>Beyond the base tiers, there is a handful of add-on channels and packages, which range from $2 to $15 a month.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Sony used to offer Vue for as low as $30 a month in all but a handful of major markets, mainly as a way of offsetting its lack of local network coverage in most areas. But the company recently raised the price to major-market levels across the board, even for those who were already subscribed to a lower-priced plan.</p><p>Sony has steadily added more local networks in that time, but not everywhere, meaning some subscribers have had to deal with a straight price hike.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-52>2. How many channels does it have?</h3></p><p>Vue's Access tier has about 45 channels. The next tier, Core, has about 60. Then there's an Elite tier with 90. Finally, an Ultra tier takes the Elite package and adds HBO and Showtime.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-54>3. Which major channels are</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Sony <a href=# id=90cac121-bb2e-519b-8e99-bde6aa52a796>dropped its partnership</a> with Viacom in November, which means Vue has no way to stream Comedy Central, MTV, Spike, Nickelodeon, or any other Viacom property. Those are the biggest outright absences.</p><p>As with Sling TV, Vue's relationship with the big four networks is complicated. In total, Vue <a href=# id=37760dc6-716c-5a1d-9447-bfe9214e75f6>delivers more local networks</a> nationwide than any of its peers. This is at least part of why Sony bumped Vue's price nationwide — securing those deals isn't cheap.</p><p>However, only a handful of very large markets can watch CBS, ABC, Fox, and NBC live. Most others have to watch shows from at least some of the big four networks on demand, a day after they air. You may get one live, or you may get three. But you won't get all four. And in some markets, CBS is unavailable altogether.</p><p>Just be sure to check <a href=# id=628d3796-ba3a-550d-a5a3-79ff2bc30aa8>where you stand</a> first — or buy an antenna. This is another reminder that live-TV services aren't wresting power away from media and cable giants just yet.</p><p>PlayStation Vue (continued)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-60>4. Does it include ESPN?</h3></p><p>Yes. Even in its base Access tier, PlayStation Vue includes both ESPN and ESPN 2. Other ESPN channels are relegated to higher tiers and add-ons, though.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-62>5. What about local sports and non-ESPN sports networks?</h3></p><p>The entry-level Access tier includes Fox Sports 1 and NBC Sports Network.</p><p>Going up a tier adds other national sports channels like the NFL Network and MLB Network, as well as regional sports networks from Fox, Comcast/NBC, and the like.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Sony recently introduced a separate $10-a-month Sports Pack that includes NFL RedZone, some extra ESPN channels, and national feeds for various Comcast/NBC regional sports channels and NESN (a Boston-based regional sports channel). This is available only to non-Access subscribers, so adding it would bring your total cost to at least $55 a month.</p><p>Still, there's no guarantee Vue will have all regional sports networks in a given market, and exactly which games those networks are allowed to air <a href=# id=9077074b-59e8-5ca6-a11b-f1e25147d3b9>can vary</a>. Sony has been expanding its regional support over time, but not every gap is filled yet.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-67>6. What about HBO?</h3></p><p>HBO is available as an add-on to one of the core bundles. It costs $15 a month on its own, the same as HBO's standalone HBO Now streaming service.</p><p>PlayStation Vue (continued)</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-70>7. Which devices does it support?</h3></p><p>While it has PlayStation in the name, Vue does work with boxes beyond Sony's PS4 and PS3. This is one of Vue's biggest strengths: Roku boxes, Apple TV (2015), Amazon Fire TV, iOS, Android, and Android TV are all supported. The only major absentee is Microsoft's Xbox One.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-72>8. Does it have DVR so I can record shows I missed?</h3></p><p>Yes. With <a href=# id=2dae1646-7176-57e0-a304-b530a14cc620>few exceptions</a>, you can record whatever show you want to the cloud. There's no limit on how many hours you can record, but you can save each recording for up to 28 days after it airs.</p><p>Sony recently added the ability to watch things from your DVR outside of your home internet network, too, though that option isn't available for everything (namely CBS).</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The company <a href=# id=9704d96a-4082-5799-9c7f-abec5f99cc37>does say</a> it will "occasionally" replace your DVR recordings with the on-demand version of certain programs, though, particularly when "a specific episode hasn't recently aired" or when it doesn't have the DVR rights for that show. That means you may have to watch ads.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-76>9. Can I pause and rewind live TV?</h3></p><p>Yes. Generally speaking, Vue allows you to pause and rewind more channels than its peers.</p><p>Like every other live-TV service, though, it can't make every program of every show available to watch on demand.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-79>10. How many people can use it at once?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can have up to five streams going at a time. That's more than any other service.</p><p>However, some channels still won't work outside of your home network. And things can vary depending on what devices you use: Sony <a href=# id=2cdb45fc-d71c-5afc-bb6e-430ac0259560>says that</a> only one PS4 console and one PS3 console can stream simultaneously on one network and that there can be only three separate streams simultaneously from iOS, Android, and a web browser.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-82>11. Any other extras I should know about?</h3></p><p>In our testing, PlayStation Vue has had the fewest technical problems. You may be less lucky, but that, combined with the full-ish feature set and simple enough interface, makes Vue feel like the most polished service to date.</p><p>Along with DirecTV Now, Vue also <a href=# id=b100df5d-c14f-54d5-af2d-18b8df74dcb9>works with more</a> TV Everywhere apps than its peers. That means you can use your Vue login to watch various network streaming apps that normally require a cable account.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>DirecTV Now</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-86>1. How much does it cost?</h3></p><p>DirecTV Now's <a href=# id=617cdb15-9a45-51fa-805b-6720ec962770>entry-level package</a>, called Live a Little, costs $35 a month. A larger Just Right tier then costs $50 a month. Next, a Go Big tier costs $60 a month. Finally, a Gotta Have It tier costs $70 a month.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-88>2. How many channels does it have?</h3></p><p>The base tier includes a little more than 60 channels. The Just Right tier raises that to about 80. The Go Big tier brings it to about 100. Then the final tier includes about 120.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You can also add HBO, Cinemax, and Starz for separate monthly fees. A Showtime add-on will be available in the near future, too.</p><p>Purely on a cost-per-channel basis, this makes DirecTV Now the densest service of the bunch. Seen another way, it's also the most cable-like streaming service.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-92>3. Which major channels are</h3></p><p>CBS was the big absentee, but AT&T has since <a href=# id=2b376405-67ef-58ac-93a9-b9b11cccf9d9>patched that hole</a> and now says it will add CBS and The CW to all of its packages. Showtime will be available as an $8 monthly add-on, while others like CBS Sports Network will be available in higher tiers.</p><p>Still, AT&T is playing catch-up: <a href=# id=baf1975a-79b5-53f0-be70-45ebee9a9d39>Only a select number</a> of major markets will get CBS and The CW to start, and on-demand support for those networks won't be available right away.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Getting the other three major networks, once again, depends on where you live. A small selection of major markets broadcast NBC, ABC, and Fox live — some carry two, others get only one. If one of those channels isn't available to watch live, DirecTV Now will make its primetime content available on demand after a 24-hour delay.</p><p>It's worth using <a href=# id=3e400845-8ab9-519c-9e01-b0edb280d3cc>AT&T's channel-lookup tool</a> to see if you need an antenna. Vue's local network support generally covers more people, but AT&T is steadily getting closer.</p><p>DirecTV Now (continued)</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-98>4. Does it include ESPN?</h3></p><p>Yes. Even in the base tier, you get ESPN and ESPN 2 by default. Other ESPN channels are relegated to the next-highest tier, though.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-100>5. What about local sports and non-ESPN sports networks?</h3></p><p>The entry-level tier includes Fox Sports 1 and NBC Sports Network.</p><p>As with Vue, you need to step up a tier to get regional sports channels from Fox and Comcast/NBC.

Its interface is a radical departure from Hulu proper, so it may take some time to get used to. It is entirely focused on shows — there's not a channel grid in sight — and it relies heavily on algorithmically knowing which shows you're more likely to watch.</p><p>In my time with it, that's worked fine. Hulu puts you through a whole onboarding procedure to get a feel for your interests, and the service has since pointed me toward the kind of sports- and comedy-related programming I tend to like.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If you use Hulu proper, it also does well to blend the shows you've been watching into those recommendations. It nicely calls up episode you've started but not finished, too. And the dedicated My Channels tab, which cuts out every network you don't care about, is great.</p><p>If you want to just browse around, though, be prepared to do some swiping. The whole user interface is gorgeous, with big graphics and clean text everywhere, but it splits everything up into many, many cards and tabs. Simply getting to your DVR takes too long.</p><p>The search function could also use some fine-tuning. I had moments when searching for a particular show didn't bring up an episode that was airing live at that time, for instance.</p><p>Still, this is really the only service that successfully blends live TV with on-demand content. You can swipe to live shows specifically if you'd like, but by default your "lineup" (the main menu) swirls on-demand, live shows, and DVR recordings together, centering them on what kind of thing you want to watch, rather than where they originate. That's significant, and it makes you less beholden to time than you are anywhere else.</p><p>Hulu is generally steady in terms of technical streaming quality, too, but it's not immune to the occasional stutter.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-211>1.

It has <a href=# id=bdce6344-b459-583e-b38e-cea17114f204>raised millions</a> to expand its horizons, but at its core, live sports of all kinds are still its bread and butter. Its <a href=# id=063ca22f-a6c5-55a4-b4e7-0753df8d519d>current channel lineup</a> reflects that.</p><p>Familiar names like NBC, Fox, FX, USA, and A&E are there, but there are no CBS channels, no ABC/Disney channels, no Turner channels, no Viacom channels, and no AMC, among others, as of this writing. CBS-owned <a href=# id=6e780161-3969-5a44-ba69-29eafe54dcdd>stations are coming</a> to some markets in the near future, but this is easily the weakest channel lineup for a general purpose audience.</p><p>Fubo's local network coverage isn't terrible for what it is, but those networks are generally available live only in major markets. Check the company's <a href=# id=179473e4-e85f-5992-baed-7a6768000d93>local network support list</a> before you subscribe.

Does it include ESPN?</h3></p><p>Nope. This is what will kill Fubo TV dead for most people — it's a sports-focused streaming service without access to the country's biggest sports channel.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-223>5. What about local sports and non-ESPN sports networks?</h3></p><p>This is Fubo's whole value proposition at the moment. Fubo TV comes with a few niche sports channels that are typically unavailable or reserved for pricier tiers with rival services. Those include several BeIn Sports channels, NBA TV, Fox Soccer Plus, Fox Deportes, the Big Ten Network, and Eleven Sports. That's on top of NBC Sports Network, Fox Sports 1, and others like the Golf Channel.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Does everyone need those? Nope. But Fubo is going for that niche that wants to watch any and every sporting event on TV (particularly world soccer matches). The first thing you see when you open the app is a list of live and upcoming sporting events, with everything from baseball to darts to Australian-rules football highlighted. And its channel guide lists every sports channel above more-traditional stations.</p><p>Fubo also covers a <a href=# id=12dc50c7-43a2-56c4-8d9d-5d1c1dba024c>decent amount of regional sports networks</a> from Fox and Comcast/NBC, though, per usual, it doesn't have everything everywhere. That absence, along with its lack of ESPN and Turner channels, means it can't guarantee you'll be able to see <a href=# id=1d60937b-bfcb-5989-9000-1ba4b089259b>all your team's games</a> in a given season. But it does <a href=# id=843d8348-eab4-5478-9145-8a2e0304aef4>let you watch</a> the regional sports networks you do get outside of your home network.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-227>6.

That leaves game consoles like the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One as the biggest absences.</p><p>This doesn't tell the whole story, though, as Fubo's service is limited on some platforms more than others. The Android tablet app, for instance, supports only vertical-display mode. The Roku and Apple TV apps support only live-TV viewing, while the Fire TV and Android TV apps do not have on-demand shows. That leaves the web, Chromecast, and Fubo's smartphone app as the only fully functional platforms.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-233>8. Does it have DVR so I can record shows I missed?</h3></p><p>Yes, but it's limited. Fubo sets it up so you can record only 10 individual programs at any given time. Those individual programs are then available for only 10 days at a time.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This might be enough if you plan on recording a missed game or two, but there's no getting around the fact that this is anemic compared with the DVRs on every other live-TV service. Fubo <a href=# id=ab3b9f46-7264-5a79-9d4b-b7d602d160e0>says it's trying</a> to make more space available in the future, at least.</p><p>Beyond this, Fubo has a <a href=# id=af2cb006-0606-5809-942e-5855f790bff1>look-back</a> feature that lets you watch select sports matches for up to three days after they air. The latter applies only to sporting events, though — shows from, say, Bravo or A&E aren't included. And again, it's available only on select platforms.</p><p>Fubo TV (continued)</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-238>9.

The four major sports leagues still air on larger channels that are either not here or available on other live TV services. The same goes for MLS and the Premier League, the most popular soccer leagues among Americans.</p><p>Fubo's other problem is its interface. It looks plain, for one, but getting from the channel guide — the only way to see what's on — to whatever you're watching feels stiff. Once you start watching a show, you have to back out of it completely just to change channels. There's little in the way of personalized recommendations and no way to highlight favorite channels. Its streaming quality isn't flawless, either.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>On the plus side, you can use a Fubo login to authenticate <a href=# id=3ca600d4-f74c-5798-8ac8-f7a4ee5bbd69>a few dozen</a> network-specific streaming apps.</p><p>So which one should I get?</p><p>With Sony hiking the price of PlayStation Vue in most markets, YouTube TV expanding to more regions, and the continued improvements to Hulu and DirecTV Now, saying which live-TV service is "best" has become a bit more complicated.</p><p>The truth is there's no obvious winner — you have to assess the info, use those free trials, and see which one best fits your needs and price range.</p><p>• Still, in a vacuum, we think <strong>PlayStation Vue </strong>remains the most fully formed cable replacement. It has streamed smoothly in our testing. It's simple enough to navigate. It has no issues with device support. It lets you stream to the most devices at once — making it good for families — and you can use its login to sign into several outside streaming apps. Its channel lineup, while not flawless, compares favorably with its peers, and it supports the most local networks overall. Its DVR is relatively generous, too, and it's not terribly restrictive about letting you pause and rewind live TV.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But there's no denying that $40 a month isn't very cheap. The limitations Vue still puts on some networks when you're on the go are a pain, too.</p><p>• If you're in one of the 15 markets where <strong>YouTube TV</strong> is available, it might be your best bet instead. Its nine-month DVR is the most spacious you can buy, it has the big four networks in all but one market, and it streams smoothly. If it could integrate with YouTube proper in any meaningful way, it could be something special.</p><p>Its ad-skipping annoyances are nearly as frustrating as Hulu's, though, and it still omits channels that some people may need. Worse, it makes you use a Chromecast or AirPlay just to watch things on a TV. But if YouTube can expand its device support and make its way to more markets, it has a shot of cutting out any advantage Vue has.</p><p>• Conceptually, <strong>Hulu</strong> has the most compelling offering. The way it blends live and on-demand shows into one feels like the first step in where these services should go. It's also pleasant to look at. And if you're already a heavy Hulu user, it makes the most sense.</p><p>But the inability to skip commercials anywhere without paying extra is rough, and its interface, while attractive, can get clunky. It also charges too much for the kind of DVR space that comes standard with Vue and YouTube. It doesn't work on a web browser, either.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>• If you just want the cheapest package possible, <strong>Sling TV's Blue service</strong> is competitively priced for a bundle with regional sports. Its recently revamped interface is much easier to get around, too. But its local channel support is still lacking, it sacrifices ESPN, and its DVR is limited. Still, it's getting at a good idea by curating tightly and lowering costs.</p><p>• It's harder to recommend <strong>DirecTV Now</strong> right now given its lack of DVR and history of technical hiccups. But if you use AT&T, being able to stream it on mobile at no cost to your data cap is an advantage — as troubling as it may be. It's a no-brainer if you plan to subscribe to AT&T's unlimited data plan. AT&T is beefing up its local channel support and promising useful updates for the future, too, so it'll most likely improve.</p><p>• <strong>Fubo TV</strong> is a non-starter unless you're really into world soccer and niche sporting events.</p><p>Finally, a quick reminder of what these services are not.</p><p>As we've <a href=# id=82e11463-234c-5572-8513-5ecc0a7568c9>noted</a><a href=# id=6c687ee0-7bae-559e-81e2-2d8045547854>before</a>, none of the above live-TV services is solving the cord-cutter's conundrum: getting the shows you want, on time, whenever and wherever you want, without paying more than you have to for channels you'll never watch.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In other words, all of these services still look a lot like cable packages — they're just smaller cable packages, delivered over the internet, with slightly lower starting prices. The major networks are still in the driver's seat.</p><p>There are other issues:</p><p>• The on-demand selection is similar in every service, and almost exactly like what you'd get with a cable subscription.</p><p>• In most cases, on-demand and live content still feel stuck in separate silos.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>• They usually won't let you fast-forward through every show.</p><p>• And most significantly, they've all had bugs and technical issues.</p><p>Today, if you're looking for cable, you should just buy cable. It's reliable.</p><p>That said, here's what you do get from these services.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Though all these services can have their technical hiccups, they're not unusable. Their interfaces are clean and easy enough to navigate.</p><p>And when they work, they have value for those who can't quit the cord. They cover gaps that a hodgepodge of Netflix, Hulu, and insular streaming services can't — most notably with sports, and, well, watching popular shows as they air.</p><p>As more cords are cut, they should make more sense. And even if they don't take a wrecking ball to the TV industry's current power structure, they all should improve.</p><p>Nobody has cracked the code just yet.</p><p>But again, nothing here is truly groundbreaking. The way the cable and TV industries are set up in America makes it so adding one of these services to your internet bill may not save much money in the first place. And cable is arguably a more complete product overall.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If you aren't beholden to the "cable lite" idea most of these services are selling, you may be better off saving your cash and mixing Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Now, and the like.</p><p>For now, growing pains remain throughout. That's unlikely to change until structures that hold the TV industry in place crumble completely. But it may not be long until that day comes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWekmrCpedOhnKudXZa%2FpnmVZqSaop%2BnerSx0a%2BgnJ2jYsGprdNmo56sXa68tnnSramemZ1iuarCxGarr2Wfq7KzedOhnGahnqmys7rErWShnaKawHDGkJupm7KV</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftech-there-are-6-major-services-that-let-you-stream-live-tv-over-the-internet-heres.html&text=There%20are%206%20major%20services%20that%20let%20you%20stream%20live%20TV%20over%20the%20internet%20%20here%27s%20how%20they%20compare&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftech-there-are-6-major-services-that-let-you-stream-live-tv-over-the-internet-heres.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftech-there-are-6-major-services-that-let-you-stream-live-tv-over-the-internet-heres.html&title=There%20are%206%20major%20services%20that%20let%20you%20stream%20live%20TV%20over%20the%20internet%20%20here%27s%20how%20they%20compare" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftech-there-are-6-major-services-that-let-you-stream-live-tv-over-the-internet-heres.html&title=There%20are%206%20major%20services%20that%20let%20you%20stream%20live%20TV%20over%20the%20internet%20%20here%27s%20how%20they%20compare" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftech-there-are-6-major-services-that-let-you-stream-live-tv-over-the-internet-heres.html&title=There%20are%206%20major%20services%20that%20let%20you%20stream%20live%20TV%20over%20the%20internet%20%20here%27s%20how%20they%20compare" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftech-there-are-6-major-services-that-let-you-stream-live-tv-over-the-internet-heres.html&description=There%20are%206%20major%20services%20that%20let%20you%20stream%20live%20TV%20over%20the%20internet%20%20here%27s%20how%20they%20compare" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./des-logements-prefabriques-en-atelier-pour-nogent-perche-habitat-28.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Des logements prfabriqus en atelier pour Nogent Perche Habitat (28)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dictators.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Worst and Most Famous Dictators in History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
