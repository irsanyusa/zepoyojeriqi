What matters is the number of friends you have in your religious community. Ten is the magic number; if you have that many, you’ll be happier. Religious people, in other words, are happier because they feel connected to a community of like-minded people.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And if you have the cash, pay for dinner with a friend. <strong>Money definitely can make you happier – when you <a href=# rel=noopener>spend it on other people</a>.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Via <a href=# rel=noopener>Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=28><p>By the end of the day, individuals who spent money on others were measurably happier than those who spent money on themselves — even though there were no differences between the groups at the beginning of the day.

To our surprise, individuals who’d experienced one awful event had more intense strengths (and therefore higher well-being) than individuals who had none.
