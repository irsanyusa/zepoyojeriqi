''It has been crazy fun since I arrived... It is just a beautiful different world. It's weird, I feel like I have been here before.''</p><p>This is her first ever visit to Nigeria and I was curious to know why, ''Simply holiday, I felt like I was too old to not have seen the motherland by now, specifically Nigeria where they say I am from,'' she laughs. ''Because I took a DNA test, ancestry DNA, hopefully, they are not lying to me, they say 33% I am Nigerian.''</p><p>''I had a little bit of Jollof rice, that was cool,'' she replied when asked if she has tasted any Nigerian meal yet.</p><p><strong>Are there plans to work with a Nigerian artist?</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>''I would love to, I guess it is just about working with the right ones, I am down...
