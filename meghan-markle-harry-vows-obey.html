Many of its phrases, which date back to the <a href=# rel=noopener>original 16th century Book of Common Prayer</a>, will be familiar to wedding-goers from all of the world: “dearly beloved,” “forever hold his peace,” “as long as you both shall live.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But in other ways, the words spoken by the Prince and Markle — who was <a href=# rel=noopener>baptized and confirmed</a> in the Church of England in preparation for the wedding — are decidedly modern. And one of those tweaks to tradition is likely to drawn particular attention: Markle’s decision not to promise to “obey” her new husband. Instead, Markle and Prince Harry each declared that they would love, comfort, honor, protect and be faithful to the other, and then vowed to have, to hold, to love and to cherish.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, the new royal’s choice not to promise to obey Prince Harry isn’t exactly groundbreaking. That change to the traditional verbiage has evolved over the course of many decades, building on a service that has changed in many other ways too.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So where does the evolution begin? The Church of England split from Roman Catholicism in the 16th century, during the English Reformation. English history before that point included many different ways of solemnizing a marriage, from the Catholic mass to the more<a href=# rel=noopener> casual medieval practice</a> of merely announcing consent to be married to traditional <a href=# rel=noopener>Anglo-Saxon-origin wedding vows</a>, which today sound both familiar and rather colorful. In that wedding, the bride would promise to take her new husband, “to have and to hold, from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer and poorer, in sickness and health, to be bonny and buxom, in bed and at board, till death do us part.” (As the Telegraph has <a href=# rel=noopener>pointed out</a>, “bonny and buxom” at the time would have meant “good and obedient.”)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It wasn’t until 1753 that <a href=# rel=noopener>English law first required</a> that marriage take place with a Church of England minister in order to count (a law that held until the 19th century), but marriage in a church was common before then. For example, the Salisbury Cathedral in particular left an outsize imprint on the way pre-Reformation Roman Catholic Britons prayed, shaping what’s known <a href=# rel=noopener>as the Sarum Rite</a> or Sarum Use — the Salisbury method of worship. The 1549 Book of Common Prayer that was developed during the Reformation used the Sarum Rite as one of its sources, including for the wedding service.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the original Book of Common Prayer, the vows for the wife are slightly different than those for the man: he promises to love, comfort, honor and keep her; she promises to love, honor and keep, but also to obey and serve. That prayer book influenced many other English-language Church services, so those phrases pop up all over the place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As liturgical studies expert Bryan Spinks <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote in a 1981 article on marriage in the Church of England</a>, wedding services within the Church of England have long been basically just revisions of the 16th century Book of Common Prayer wedding, at least until a more radical <a href=# rel=noopener>experimental liturgy</a> was introduced as an option in the 1970s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But even so, as the liturgy remained fairly stable, “obey” was an early recipient of more minor tweaks.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1928 — just two years after British women were <a href=# rel=noopener>first allowed to own property</a> the same way that men were — an attempted <a href=# rel=noopener>revision</a> to the Church of England marriage service <a href=# rel=noopener>left out</a> the “<a href=# rel=noopener>obey</a>.” The 1977 revision <a href=# rel=noopener>did too</a>. More recently, the Church of England Archbishops’ Council has formally acknowledged problems with the “obey” wording; in 2006, the Council published a report on domestic violence that <a href=# rel=noopener>noted</a> that the promise was part of “standards or expectations of women and men within marriage” that were problematic and outdated.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But just because some Church of England congregants might haven chosen to skip “obey” almost a century ago, that doesn’t mean the royals did the same.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Queen Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947, there had been some <a href=#>public debate over whether a future Queen ought to be promising to obey</a> anyone. But she decided that regardless of her role as Queen, her role as wife would be traditional. As TIME <a href=#>noted</a> in its 1947 coverage of the marriage:</p><figure class=text-left readability=34><p>Remembered too will be the silvered sounding of trumpets, the great beat of the Abbey organ, and the belling voice of Canterbury saying: ‘Philip, wilt thou have this woman,’ and ‘Elizabeth Alexandra Mary, wilt thou have this man,’ and the girl’s response, ‘to love, cherish, and to obey,’ audible only to those nearest in the Abbey (but clear on the radio), and the tall, tender and slightly bending young man as he said: ‘With this ring I thee wed, and with my body I thee worship.’</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So it was decades later that this particular change to tradition — the lack of “obey” — was <a href=# rel=noopener>first</a> embraced at a major royal wedding: Princess Diana and Prince Charles, in their 1981 wedding, both promised simply to have, hold, love and cherish. (She did <a href=#>mess up her new husband’s name</a>, though.)</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some royals continued to promise to obey even after that, but Prince William and Kate Middleton followed his parents’ footsteps.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And they weren’t alone. When the <a href=# rel=noopener>Cambridges</a> <a href=# rel=noopener>wed</a> in 2011, a member of the Church of England General Synod <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> the Telegraph that the vow of obedience was “relatively rare” in modern weddings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So Markle’s decision on the “obey” question shouldn’t surprise anyone. Especially for a long-time advocate for women’s rights, the equality of vows is fitting — and as she has <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> that she plans to continue that advocacy as a member of the royal family, her adherence to modern royal tradition is fitting too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamdrhHl8jqacoKCRo3qurdGko55lmJa%2Fs8WMr6awq12kr6bFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markle-harry-vows-obey.html&text=Meghan%20Markle%20Not%20Saying%20%27Obey%27%20in%20Her%20Vows%20Has%20Long%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markle-harry-vows-obey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-harry-vows-obey.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20Not%20Saying%20%27Obey%27%20in%20Her%20Vows%20Has%20Long%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeghan-markle-harry-vows-obey.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20Not%20Saying%20%27Obey%27%20in%20Her%20Vows%20Has%20Long%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markle-harry-vows-obey.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%20Not%20Saying%20%27Obey%27%20in%20Her%20Vows%20Has%20Long%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markle-harry-vows-obey.html&description=Meghan%20Markle%20Not%20Saying%20%27Obey%27%20in%20Her%20Vows%20Has%20Long%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1598752-father-daughter-dance-songs-celebrate-unbreakable-bond.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20 best father-daughter dance songs to celebrate that unbreakable bond">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./i-used-to-see-my-body-as-the-enemy-how-iskra-lawrence-came-from-self-hate-to-self-love-812786.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I Used to See My Body as the Enemy, How Iskra Lawrence Came From Self-Hate to Self-Love">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
