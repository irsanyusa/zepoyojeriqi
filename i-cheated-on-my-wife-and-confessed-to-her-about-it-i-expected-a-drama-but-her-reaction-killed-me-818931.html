He&nbsp;shared his story, where his infidelity has become a&nbsp;start of&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge drama with an&nbsp;unexpected ending. The man was deeply shocked when he&nbsp;confessed to&nbsp;his wife about his affair with his client. He&nbsp;expected any reaction, but not the one that his wife actually demonstrated. Now, the man is&nbsp;desperate about how things turned against him and is&nbsp;asking our readers for advice on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;proceed with his family life.</p><p><h2>Sean had a&nbsp;short-term affair and confessed about his infidelity to&nbsp;his wife.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea3/b10/3664425b3796106ddef9059818.jpg><p>Sean, 36, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told&nbsp;us about his very complicated family situation. The man expected that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;judged by&nbsp;many people, but he&nbsp;still wants to&nbsp;get some opinions and some pieces of&nbsp;advice from people, who won’t remain indifferent to&nbsp;his problem.</p><p>The man opened his letter, saying, “My&nbsp;wife Rosa and&nbsp;I have been happily married for 15&nbsp;years now. We’ve been through many life situations together, and we’ve always found the way out together. We’ve been more than spouses all this time, we’ve been kindred spirits and our <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> has been based upon trust and mutual understanding. We&nbsp;never lied to&nbsp;each other and never cheated. But recently, things took an&nbsp;opposite turn and our family is&nbsp;now falling apart with a&nbsp;speed of&nbsp;light.”</p><p>Sean explained, “I&nbsp;know&nbsp;I did something really awful and disgusting, I&nbsp;cheated on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife with a&nbsp;client of&nbsp;mine. I&nbsp;don’t really know why&nbsp;I did all this, my&nbsp;body felt like it&nbsp;was on&nbsp;autopilot, and after a&nbsp;short time&nbsp;I couldn’t take the guilt anymore. I&nbsp;immediately cut off my&nbsp;affair partner. I&nbsp;ended my&nbsp;relationship with her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;client, too, and passed her contract to&nbsp;a&nbsp;coworker. I&nbsp;have been no&nbsp;contact with her ever since. I&nbsp;also confessed about this to&nbsp;my&nbsp;wife, and I’ve been doing individual therapy since then, too.”</p><p><h2>Sean expected a&nbsp;very emotional reaction from his wife and was partly prepared for&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c82/576/f6825a53ae9715b1d3bd111fad.jpg><p>Sean confessed, “At&nbsp;first, my&nbsp;wife got really upset and depressed, she was absolutely angry. I&nbsp;was seriously worried about her mental state. I&nbsp;did expect some big drama, but I’ve never seen her so&nbsp;depressed before. I&nbsp;begged her to&nbsp;not divorce&nbsp;me.<br>I&nbsp;proposed some counseling, therapy, even allowing her to&nbsp;have relationship with other men, but she wasn’t interested. She just asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;leave her alone and give her more time for coping with pain on&nbsp;her own. She insisted that&nbsp;I must move out and wait until she calls me&nbsp;with her suggestions about our future life together.”</p><p>The man didn’t object against his wife’s will. Sean wrote, “I&nbsp;picked my&nbsp;things and left to&nbsp;live at&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’. I&nbsp;called her every day, she sounded broken and frustrated, I&nbsp;could hear it&nbsp;in&nbsp;her voice that she was totally hurt, and&nbsp;I could understand this. She refused any help from me&nbsp;and only kept telling me&nbsp;that she needed more space, which&nbsp;I allowed her to&nbsp;have.”</p><p><h2>One day, the behavior of&nbsp;Sean’s wife totally changed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/724/458/c3ec9253c6a8da71a2b28d70eb.jpg><p>Sean wrote, “3&nbsp;weeks after&nbsp;I confessed to&nbsp;her about my&nbsp;infidelity, my&nbsp;wife suddenly started behaving in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very strange way. She called me&nbsp;and asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;take my&nbsp;things and move back in&nbsp;to&nbsp;our house, which&nbsp;I happily did. She said she wanted to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;work&nbsp;us out, and she instantly jumped&nbsp;in, being the best wife a&nbsp;man can ask for.”</p><p>Sean revealed, “She cooked my&nbsp;favorite dishes, she left me&nbsp;loving notes, and bought herself new clothes to&nbsp;look even more attractive to&nbsp;me. Her reactions were lukewarm at&nbsp;best. She smiled and thanked&nbsp;me, and she kept telling me&nbsp;how she loved me&nbsp;more than anything. She barely initiated a&nbsp;talk about what had happened between&nbsp;us, and&nbsp;I didn’t bring it&nbsp;up&nbsp;either. I&nbsp;was shocked about this change, but&nbsp;I thought she was just being a&nbsp;strong and reasonable woman, and&nbsp;I believed that she decided not to&nbsp;let a&nbsp;short-term affair to&nbsp;spoil our marriage.”</p><p>The man wrote, “I&nbsp;didn’t find my&nbsp;wife’s behavior suspicious at&nbsp;all, but there was one thing that&nbsp;I couldn’t understand, and she would never explain it&nbsp;to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;found out that she started visiting a&nbsp;doctor, a&nbsp;gynecologist, and she did it&nbsp;too often, like, it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;regular checkup or&nbsp;something. I&nbsp;mean, she had appointments with the doctor almost every week, and these visits started shortly after&nbsp;I confessed to&nbsp;her about cheating.”</p><p><h2>Sean was worried about his wife’s health and he&nbsp;confronted her about her frequent appointments with a&nbsp;doctor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e6/ffe/00b6bd5010a176bc0292f237d1.jpg><p>Sean wrote, “I&nbsp;was thinking of&nbsp;some serious health problems that my&nbsp;wife might have had, and these visits didn’t let me&nbsp;sleep peacefully at&nbsp;night. She did have some issues with her reproductive system, and this is&nbsp;why we&nbsp;didn’t have any kids. Or&nbsp;so&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought.”</p><p>The man revealed, “When I&nbsp;finally confronted my&nbsp;wife about her health and her visits to&nbsp;the gynecologist, she smiled and then announced to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that she didn’t have any health problems at&nbsp;all. And she said that she was visiting the doctor because she consulted about her <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a>. I&nbsp;was dumbfounded, then&nbsp;I felt so&nbsp;happy that we&nbsp;will have a&nbsp;baby.<br>But then my&nbsp;spouse dropped a&nbsp;bombshell on&nbsp;me. She confessed that this baby wasn’t mine. She said she had been having an&nbsp;affair with another man, just like&nbsp;I did with another woman, and that she fell pregnant from him. I&nbsp;could feel how all my&nbsp;life was turning upside down at&nbsp;that moment.”</p><p>Sean wrote, “My&nbsp;wife said that everything that happened in&nbsp;our family was fair, and she believed that each of&nbsp;us got what we&nbsp;deserved. She suggested staying together, and she said&nbsp;I could adopt the baby if&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so, explaining that she had no&nbsp;longer been in&nbsp;touch with the baby’s bio dad and saying that this man wouldn’t have been happy if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had found out she was pregnant.”</p><p>The man is&nbsp;totally broken, and he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;feelings about the situation. He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;gut feeling that the baby is&nbsp;mine and that my&nbsp;wife had never been unfaithful to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;believe what she was saying was a&nbsp;revenge, she wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;feel the pain that she was feeling after my&nbsp;painful confession to&nbsp;her. But at&nbsp;the same time, what if&nbsp;she wasn’t lying and the baby isn’t mine? What should I&nbsp;do in&nbsp;this situation? I’m torn.”</p><p>And here’s yet another drama based on&nbsp;<a href=#>infidelity</a>. This time, a&nbsp;woman took a&nbsp;married man away from his family. She expected to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;happy family with her beloved, but karma hit her hard and now the woman is&nbsp;totally desperate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZur8eemK2dlGK8r3nMsmSwoZaaeqK6w2aaqKaWmsC0scNmq6hlmJq%2Fbq3BqKytZZmpeqp5xLGnnpukmrFurYydqZqlkWKvtsCMoZyrZaKarqTAyKilZqOZobmmsIymnGZwYW2GdH2O</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-cheated-on-my-wife-and-confessed-to-her-about-it-i-expected-a-drama-but-her-reaction-killed-me-818931.html&text=I%20Cheated%20on%20My%20Wife%20and%20Confessed%20%20Her%20Reaction%20Utterly%20Confused%20Me&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-cheated-on-my-wife-and-confessed-to-her-about-it-i-expected-a-drama-but-her-reaction-killed-me-818931.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-cheated-on-my-wife-and-confessed-to-her-about-it-i-expected-a-drama-but-her-reaction-killed-me-818931.html&title=I%20Cheated%20on%20My%20Wife%20and%20Confessed%20%20Her%20Reaction%20Utterly%20Confused%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-cheated-on-my-wife-and-confessed-to-her-about-it-i-expected-a-drama-but-her-reaction-killed-me-818931.html&title=I%20Cheated%20on%20My%20Wife%20and%20Confessed%20%20Her%20Reaction%20Utterly%20Confused%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-cheated-on-my-wife-and-confessed-to-her-about-it-i-expected-a-drama-but-her-reaction-killed-me-818931.html&title=I%20Cheated%20on%20My%20Wife%20and%20Confessed%20%20Her%20Reaction%20Utterly%20Confused%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-cheated-on-my-wife-and-confessed-to-her-about-it-i-expected-a-drama-but-her-reaction-killed-me-818931.html&description=I%20Cheated%20on%20My%20Wife%20and%20Confessed%20%20Her%20Reaction%20Utterly%20Confused%20Me" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./i-prophesied-about-coronavirus-but-couldnt-pronounce-the-name-reverend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I prophesied about coronavirus but couldn't pronounce the name - Reverend">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-much-money-does-francesca-eastwood-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Much Money Does Francesca Eastwood Make?
