More than two years into the pandemic, consumers' social habits are still in flux. And while personal finances are the driving force of the cutbacks, consumers who are looking to curb their drinking habits for health and wellness reasons may see cutting spending in this category as a win-win.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Consumer expenditures dropped across all adult beverage categories in March amid broader discretionary spending cuts</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Consumers aren’t slashing spending on alcohol because it’s become more expensive: While the consumer price index for food at home was up 10% annually in March, alcohol’s price index only increased by 3.7% during that time.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">These declines in spending are driven by less consumption both at home and on premises. Even as consumers registered the highest <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>comfort levels</a> with going to a restaurant or bar since Morning Consult started tracking in 2020, average monthly visits to a bar dipped in March compared with both the previous month and March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Alcohol is not a consumer necessity — though it might have felt that way during the early, anxiety-ridden days of the pandemic. With inflation hanging over the heads of millions of Americans, cutting back on alcohol spending means more room for more essential items: food, housing and utilities. Seasonality could also play a role here: While the holiday season from October to December is marked with social occasions and food and drink consumption, drinking occasions often dip in January and February as consumers' social calendars clear and they reset their annual health and wellness goals.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The share of consumers drinking beer, wine and liquor at least weekly is declining</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That means fewer beers, martinis and lambruscos — these decreases are being felt across all categories. The share of those who said they drank at least once a week declined across noncraft beer, wine and liquor categories between October 2021 and March 2022. Declines in weekly drinking during that time were steepest in beer – dropping 6 percentage points from 25% to 19%.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Stepping back, the share of those who drink beer and liquor at least once a week has declined, while the share of weekly wine drinking may be returning to pre-pandemic levels.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Prior to the pandemic, liquor was experiencing growth in weekly consumption frequency in 2019 and early 2020. When COVID-19 hit, reported consumption plummeted and has yet to recover. In early 2022, the share of those drinking liquor at least weekly declined again amid spending cuts.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Drops in alcohol spending are steepest among millennials and high-income consumers</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The alcohol industry’s two key demographics — millennials and high-income consumers — are cutting their alcohol spending the most, especially between February and March.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But what’s potentially more concerning for adult beverage brands is that the share of consumers who say they drink alcohol at all has declined among these same groups.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The decrease in spending on alcohol among millennials is underscored by an 8-point drop in the share who said they drink alcohol between October 2021 and March 2022. Similarly, consumers with an annual household income of $100,000 or more are now 10 points less likely to say they drink alcohol than they were last fall.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s one thing to cut back on drinking, but it’s an entirely different story to stop identifying as someone who drinks. As consumers fold more of their typical activities back into their routines, from traveling to in-office work, they may find themselves re-evaluating some of their pandemic-era habits like alcohol consumption. More than 1 in 4 millennials said they planned to participate in Dry January in 2022, an exercise in <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>(near) abstinence</a> for the month, with health the most cited reason for participating. It is likely that the prospect of securing both a healthy budget and a healthy body by cutting down on consumption is appealing to consumers.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX5a5pLvHqKNmq6Cau6W1zaBkqKZdqbWmecOemqWhnpo%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falcohol-spending-on-the-decline.html&text=Alcohol%20Drinking%20Declines%20as%20Consumers%20Slash%20Discretionary%20Spending&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falcohol-spending-on-the-decline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falcohol-spending-on-the-decline.html&title=Alcohol%20Drinking%20Declines%20as%20Consumers%20Slash%20Discretionary%20Spending" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falcohol-spending-on-the-decline.html&title=Alcohol%20Drinking%20Declines%20as%20Consumers%20Slash%20Discretionary%20Spending" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falcohol-spending-on-the-decline.html&title=Alcohol%20Drinking%20Declines%20as%20Consumers%20Slash%20Discretionary%20Spending" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falcohol-spending-on-the-decline.html&description=Alcohol%20Drinking%20Declines%20as%20Consumers%20Slash%20Discretionary%20Spending" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1587635-lady-21-saves-money-uses-build-1-room-herself.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="House Plan for 1 Room: Lady Buys Cement Blocks, Builds Portable Home with her Savings">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./9-bad-habits-that-will-keep-your-home-messy-no-matter-how-hard-you-try-to-keep-it-clean-801721.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="9 Bad Habits That Will Keep Your Home Messy No Matter How Hard You Try to Keep It Clean">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
