Check out our ultimate survival kit to keep you cool, calm, and collected. Now let's get to these must-have products designed to help you enjoy every moment of the season.</p><h2>1. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>water-resistant SPF 50+ sunscreen stick</a> clearly works. Just one catch, though: you have to apply it evenly for the desired effect. The product is a popular choice for sun protection due to its lightweight, non-greasy formula.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f61/f55/ee0be6536a921547a13f7d5374.jpg><p>This sunscreen offers protection against both UVA and UVB rays.

I was not careful with the application technique, so I obviously missed spots, as seen in the photo. It works really well, as seen in the pale areas on my arms. The missed areas are the red areas and where my swimsuit was.</i><br><i>While this experience will make for some silly tan lines, the product itself works well if you are careful. I was in the water 20 minutes after application, so it works fast in my opinion. - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Lucky3</i></a></li></ul><h2>2. Use these <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cooling towels</a> to keep you cool and comfy during intense workouts or hot days. They are made from a breathable, quick-drying microfiber material that provides instant cooling relief when wet. The towels are lightweight and easy to carry.

I gave one to each of the girls I went with. They worked really well and kept us cool in the 100+ degree heat.</i><br><i>I ended up tying mine around my head, similar to a headband. It kept the sweat off my face and kept me cool! I thought I'd only use mine for the festival, but I've actually kept it to use in my garden as well. It's also helpful while mowing! - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Kayla</i></a></li></ul><h2>3. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hydrating face primer</a> makes your makeup look flawless and lasts longer. So it is a must-have for hot summer days.

It’s quite flawless. Very pleased with this product. - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Sharon L Gentry</i></a></li></ul><h2>4. Use this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cooling bandana</a> to help your four-legged friend stay comfortable during hot summer days.

Living in TX, it's hard to find something for her to wear and stay cool during the summer heat. She doesn't mind this bandana at all, and it keeps her cool when we go places during the summer.</i><br><i>Fits perfectly, stays on, keeps her cool, and is very affordable. - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Shawna</i></a></li></ul><h2>5. See when you need to reapply sunscreen with this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>innovative solution</a>. These stickers ensure effective sunscreen application and reapplication. They use patented SPF sensing technology to change color. It indicates—turns from clear to purple—when it's time to refresh the layer of sunscreen.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85b/2b3/f294705fea8f191b2a0fa9b89f.jpg><p>They will be particularly useful during holidays or outdoor activities.

I put on 30 SPF before going outside and didn’t notice any change. Then, my friend put on 50 SPF, and the sticker was totally clear once we got into the sun! Mine faded a good bit, but clearly a lower SPF means less protection.</i><br><i>It was a great indicator of when we needed to reapply and how much protection we were actually getting! - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Amazon Customer</i></a></li></ul><h2>6. Now here is an excellent addition to your summer essentials. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>versatile fan</a> can be attached to strollers, cribs, or even used as a handheld fan.

I use it when I spin on my stationary bike. It has three levels on the fan and also three levels for a light on the fan.

Easy to secure to the bike. - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Barbie</i></a></li></ul><h2>7.

I used them on a trip to Acadia National Park in Maine. Several of the hikes were swarming with mosquitoes, flies, and bees. As soon as our family put them on our wrists, boom, no more mosquitoes!!!! Again, I was very skeptical and so pleasantly surprised!</i><br><i>They smell like citronella, so if you don’t like that smell, you likely will not like the smell of these. They didn’t bother me or my family. I have very small wrists, as does my son, and they fit us just fine. They did fit pretty loose on my son’s wrist, so he just put it on above his watch, and it stayed on just fine.</i><br><i>So, it fits all varying wrist sizes. And they are very stretchy. However, they will stretch out. Overall, I am very pleased with this product! - </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Amazon Customer</i></a></li></ul><h2>8.
