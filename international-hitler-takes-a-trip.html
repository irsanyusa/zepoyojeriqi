Formalities and trappings moved up & down the continent. Adolf Hitler, the most grandiose tourist of all time, took a trip.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His conveyance was modern enough. Adolf Hitler’s private car is made of the strongest steel, with heavy steel reinforcements along the floor. Although a bomb or a mine might lift the car from the tracks, nothing less than a direct hit by a heavy air bomb or artillery shell could pierce it. The car is heavily padded inside. Its windows are protected by thick steel shutters that can be brought down at a moment’s notice.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first stop was Paris. There the ceremonies were a little shabby, for Herr Hitler’s levee was with the butcher’s son, Pierre Laval. But the dealings were vast. Herr Hitler knew all about his guest; knew him for a shrewd lawyer-politician who had swung rightward with the years and was out to make a deal for France.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The French Armistice was four months old, and Adolf Hitler, seconded by Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, had decided to present M. Laval with German demands for the future: reportedly the use of French naval bases at Toulon, Bizerte, airfields at Beirut, Tripoli, major concessions in North Africa, perhaps territorial cessions from continental France to Germany, Italy, Spain. As persuasion he offered “a place in the New Order”—or else starvation. M. Laval took the best he could get, hurried back to Vichy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The next stop, some 24 hours later, was in the sunny little French town of Hendaye, hard by the Spanish border—and there grandeur began to show. Spanish and German flags crowded each other along the tiny station platform. Shortly after Herr Hitler arrived, another train pulled in. For the first time in four years of collaboration, Herr Hitler met Francisco Franco. The two strolled along a regal carpet, and behind them trailed dignitaries galore—Franco’s brother-in-law, Ramón Serrano Suñer, recently made Foreign Minister after a visit to Berlin and Rome; Foreign Minister Ribbentrop; Field Marshals Brauchitsch and Keitel; significantly, the ghost writer of Hitler’s pacts, Dr. Friedrich Gaus, and many other wearers of braid and jack boots.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then the group conferred. Herr Hitler undoubtedly explained the Axis plans for Greece, and presumably there were words about Gibraltar and Spanish bases in Morocco. Herr Hitler dined and wined the Spaniard, and told him that he was going to present the Spanish Catholic Church with some gorgeous holy vessels, pictures and statues (stolen from Poland). Then the heroes parted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The next splendid stop was at a French village near Tours. Gracious as King Henry I of Brabant receiving his fractious vassals in Lohengrin, Herr Hitler did honor to the old fighter Henri Philippe Pétain and his Vice Premier Laval. The Marshal, dressed in a horizon-blue uniform like the one he wore when he was the victor of Verdun (when Adolf Hitler was a Bavarian corporal), was permitted to review some German troops, neat as an iron fence. The Führer clasped the old man’s hand and said: “I am sure you did not want war, and I regret making your acquaintance under these circumstances.” Then they talked business. The German terms were hard but not unacceptable. The Vichy press even approved the “grandeur” of Hitler’s attitude toward his beaten foes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The train went on. Four days later it pulled to a stop in a town where the Renaissance settled permanently, Florence. The Führer drove to the medieval Palazzo Vecchio, and under a portrait of Machiavelli, who once worked in the room, he and Benito Mussolini and Foreign Minister Count Ciano spread out their papers. At that moment the Italian Army was poised to reach its armored fingernails into the flesh of Greece. Hitler explained all he had done. Satisfaction was enormous. This was the 18th anniversary of Mussolini’s march on Rome, and after the genial conference the two men went out on the balcony and waved to the multitude. Close about them stood valets in medieval costume. The two drove out to a formal luncheon, then to the Pitti Palace, where hangs the lusher art of the Renaissance—the good fleshy art of Titian, Raphael and Rubens, which Adolf Hitler prefers to delicate primitives. There, in an air of preciousness, the two were regaled with chamber music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Out over the countries they could hear the music of war getting louder, the giant Axis metronome ticking a little faster. Herr Hitler’s tour and Signor Mussolini’s attack to the East brought Europe one step closer to the solid bloc which would constitute the New Order—a pan-Europe which the Axis hopes can defy Britain’s blockade and turn it against the blockaders* The alignment of France and Spain, the former in supine collaboration, the latter with willing spirit but feeble body, would make possible an all-out attack soon on the Western Mediterranean. This week German troops were reported crossing the Pyrenees packed in trucks. Penetrators in obvious cheap mufti had long been reported in Spain. Clearly the attack was not far off.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Spain and France there was no rejoicing, only a queer, unreal enthusiasm. Arriba of Madrid, the Falangist paper, tried to take consolation in a link of blood with ancient Germans. Basques, Asturians, Castilians, it said, “bear the unmistakable imprint of their Visigoth origin.” In Paris, Le Temps’s editorial writer cut a tiny gem of black futility: “There are days when it is difficult to write anything at all on any subject whatsoever.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">*Japan did not know whether it was in on this latest war or not. Its attitude toward Greece would be “considered from a practical political standpoint, not in the strict literal sense.” Since Albania, an Italian possession, was “attacked” by Greece, Japan dishonored her five-week-old mutual-defense pact with the Axis by not going to Italy’s aid.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9ub2xiboRwtc2tnKumkam2sLrApWShoaShsrN505qinqtdlnq1vsipZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finternational-hitler-takes-a-trip.html&text=INTERNATIONAL%3a%20Hitler%20Takes%20A%20Trip&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finternational-hitler-takes-a-trip.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finternational-hitler-takes-a-trip.html&title=INTERNATIONAL%3a%20Hitler%20Takes%20A%20Trip" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finternational-hitler-takes-a-trip.html&title=INTERNATIONAL%3a%20Hitler%20Takes%20A%20Trip" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finternational-hitler-takes-a-trip.html&title=INTERNATIONAL%3a%20Hitler%20Takes%20A%20Trip" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finternational-hitler-takes-a-trip.html&description=INTERNATIONAL%3a%20Hitler%20Takes%20A%20Trip" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./al-pacino-scarface-1203425588.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Looking Back at Scarface and How It Became a Cinematic Classic">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./41633-how-should-journalists-report-racially-offensive-l.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How should journalists report racially offensive language?
