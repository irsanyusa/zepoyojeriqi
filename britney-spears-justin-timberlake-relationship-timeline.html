The power pairing of the pop princess and the boy-band member turned solo crooner was a fairy-tale romance for the 2000s—until a messy and highly publicized breakup shattered the illusion, leading to more than two decades of tabloid fodder and speculation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Timberlake, the high-profile relationship boosted his celebrity, especially following their split; the singer and actor parlayed the media frenzy surrounding their breakup into promotion for his first solo album, including a music video, where he implies that Spears cheated on him. Spears, on the other hand, has suffered<strong> </strong>criticism for years, due, at least in part, to Timberlake's framing of their breakup and the ensuing sexist and insensitive media narratives that emerged. For both parties, the relationship, however brief, has become an integral part of their cultural legacies, shaping how we see them both as a former couple and stars in their own right.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In recent years, the narratives surrounding Spears and Timberlake have begun to be reframed. A reckoning with Y2K tabloid culture, misogynistic media narratives about women during that time, and particularly the relentless and often cruel scrutiny that Spears suffered as a result of her time in the spotlight have all called for a new understanding of their relationship. Now, a revealing new memoir by Spears, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Woman in Me</a>, which releases on Oct. 24, offers even more insight into one of pop culture's most notorious relationships.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here, a look back at Spears and Timberlake's relationship—from when they met as child performers in the '90s to where they stand now.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">December 1992: Britney and Justin meet while starring in The All-New Mickey Mouse Club</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears and Timberlake met for the first time as 11-year-olds in 1992, after they were both cast as "Mouseketeers" in the Disney variety TV show, The All-New Mickey Mouse Club. The show, which was the third revival of the 1950s show, The Mickey Mouse Club, was a hub for young performers who would go on to achieve superstardom; Spears and Timberlake's colleagues on the show included actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell, pop star Christina Aguilera, and Timberlake's fellow NSYNC member, JC Chasez.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Britney Spears Feared Her Family Would Kill Her, She Writes in New Book</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her memoir, Spears describes the show as "boot camp for the entertainment industry," with dance rehearsals where they would run choreography 30 times in a day, singing and acting classes, recording studio sessions, and school. According to Spears' recollection, she and Timberlake connected quickly and he was even her first kiss.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"[Once] at a sleepover, we played Truth or Dare, and someone dared Justin to kiss me," she writes in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Woman in Me</a>, a copy of which was obtained by TIME ahead of its publication. "A Janet Jackson song was playing in the background as he leaned in and kissed me."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Timberlake, the connection with Spears even at a young age was undeniable. "I was in love with her from the start," he told GQ in <a href=#>a 2006 interview</a>. "I was infatuated with her from the moment I saw her."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">1999: Britney and Justin begin secretly dating</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears and Timberlake reunited in November 1998, when Spears joined NSYNC as the opening act for the second leg of their NSYNC In Concert Tour, ahead of the 1999 release of her debut album, ...Baby One More Time. After Spears began touring with the band, rumors swirled that she was dating Timberlake, but Spears denied the speculation in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">April 1999 interview</a> with Rolling Stone.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Overseas they say it’s Nick Carter of Backstreet Boys,” she said of gossip that she was dating Timberlake or another boy bander, Lance Bass. “I have no feelings at all."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a later interview, however, Spears revealed that Timberlake had asked her out in 1999 on tour, ahead of her album's release.</p><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"He definitely asked me out," she told television broadcaster Andi Peters in a 2001 interview ahead of the Teen Choice Awards. "We were doing a radio show, and this was before ...Baby One More Time came out ... He knocks on the door and he was like, 'Can I see Britney?' And [my assistant] Felicia [Culotta] didn't know who he was and she was like, 'No ... Who are you?' And I was like, 'No! It's Justin!'"</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">September 2000: Britney and Justin make their first public appearance as a couple</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-06.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears and Timberlake made their public debut as a couple at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. While the pair didn't walk the red carpet together, opting instead for Timberlake to walk with his NSYNC bandmates and Spears solo, the couple sat together during the show.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">January 2001: Britney and Justin make their first red-carpet appearance as a couple</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-05.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Perhaps no other image has defined Spears and Timberlake's relationship as much as their matching all-denim looks for the 2001 American Music Awards red carpet. According to fashion designer Steven Gerstein, the matching denim ensembles were the couple's idea.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"Justin and Britney were dating at the time. We were in New Orleans when Britney and Justin were like, 'We're doing matching denim.' And I was like, 'How are you doing that? Who is doing that?'" Gerstein told Jezebel in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">2020 interview</a> about the looks. "Obviously, the Britney/Justin connection added fuel to the fire, but it was really organic...it was just two kids, wanting to do something cool, and being super cute, matching. It was kind of like their prom."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Britney Spears Details Her 55-Hour Marriage to Jason Alexander</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her memoir, Spears shares that she drew inspiration for the denim outfits from Southern mothers who color-coordinated their children's church outfits and has been pleased with how it's been immortalized as a part of early-aughts pop culture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I get that it was tacky, but it was also pretty great in its way, and I am always happy to see it parodied as a Halloween costume," she writes. "I've heard Justin get flak for the look. On one podcast where they were teasing him about it, he said, 'You do a lot of things when you're young and in love.' And that's exactly right. We were giddy, and those outfits reflected that."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">January 2001: Britney and Justin perform together at the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-07.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears and Timberlake shared the stage for the Super Bowl halftime show, where NSYNC was headlining with Aerosmith. Spears appeared for a performance of "Walk This Way," along with Nelly and Mary J. Blige. Spears' appearance helped to increase buzz around the couple's relationship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It's a little hard, but you know what, it's all about trust," she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a> in a backstage interview ahead of the show.

At "Challenge for the Children," a July 2001 charity basketball competition that Timberlake co-hosted with his bandmates, the couple wore matching jerseys that had their nicknames for one another ("Pinky" for Spears<strong> </strong>and "Stinky" for Timberlake) emblazoned on the back. In a later interview, Spears revealed the origin of their nicknames.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I have a ring that he gave me that I wear on my pinky so he started calling me Pinky, and then I started calling him Stinky for some reason, so that's our nicknames," Spears told Oprah in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2002</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">September 2001: Justin supports Britney ahead of her 2001 MTV Video Music Awards performance</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-09.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although it's hailed as one of her most iconic performances, Britney's 2001 VMAs performance, where she danced with an albino Burmese python wrapped around her shoulders, was one of the acts that terrified her the most.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It’s become an iconic moment in VMAs history, but it was even more terrifying than it appeared," she writes of the moment in her new memoir. "All I knew was to look down, because I felt if I looked up and caught its eye, it would kill me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears shared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram in 2021</a> that Timberlake helped to calm her nerves before the performance. In the caption to the post, she wrote: "Justin saw I could hardly talk so he held my hand and gave me a 5 minute pep talk which obviously worked."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">September 2001: Britney reveals she and Justin are living together</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>, Spears shared that when Timberlake was in L.A., he lived with her at her house. She also opened up about how their relationship evolved over the two years they had been dating.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I'm not ashamed at all to say that I love him from the bottom of my heart," she told them. "As far as love is concerned, with him, too much is not enough. He's everything...but it is a deeper love now than when I was younger. Like, we've gone through so much together and we've known each other since we were 12 years old. We know each other inside and out."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">November 2001: Justin writes and produces a song on Britney's album, Britney</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For Spears' third studio album, Timberlake wrote and produced the song "What It's Like to Be Me," alongside Spears' backup dancer, the choreographer, Wade Robson; Timberlake also contributed background vocals.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I have to say I was a little nervous at first," she said in an interview with<strong> </strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV</a>. "But then I just totally forgot that he was my boyfriend, and I just said, 'Britney, just do the vocals, don't be nervous' ... But it ended up being fine, actually."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">February 2002: Justin makes a cameo in Britney's Saturday Night Live opening monologue</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-10.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Spears did her second stint as the host and musical guest on SNL, Timberlake made a surprise appearance during her opening monologue. His guest turn fanned rumors that the couple were getting engaged, which she debunked in a post-show interview with Katie Couric, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. When asked if there was "any news on the Justin front," she had a succinct answer: "No."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Spring 2002: Britney and Justin live together in Orlando</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her memoir, Spears also reveals that by the spring of 2002, she and Justin also lived together in a house in Orlando, which they treated as their "home base."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"In my personal life, I was so happy," she writes. "Justin and I lived together in Orlando. We shared a gorgeous, airy two-story house with a tile roof and a swimming pool out back. Even though we were both working a lot, we'd make time to be home together as often as we could. I always came back every few months so Justin and I could be together for two weeks, sometimes even two months at a time."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears also shares in the memoir that she was "smitten" with Timberlake during this time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I don't know if when you're younger, love's a different thing, but what Justin and I had was special. He wouldn't even have to say anything or do anything for me to feel close to him."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">February 2002: Britney and Justin make their final red-carpet appearances together</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-04.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In early February 2002, Spears and Timberlake walked the red carpet for the Los Angeles premiere of her film, Crossroads, where she made her silver-screen debut. The film's director, Tamra Davis, said that Timberlake was a regular presence on the set to support Spears, who would doodle their names together in her notebook.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I have the book. All she was writing was 'Britney and Justin,' all these little curlicues," Davis said in a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vice</a>. "It was like looking at a teenage girl's musings—hearts and butterflies and Justin's name."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-03.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Later that month, the pair appeared together at Clive Davis' pre-Grammys party, one of their final red-carpet public appearances together.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">March 2002: Britney confirms breakup with Justin after three years together</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears seemingly confirmed the couple's breakup during her press tour for Crossroads. According to a report by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> at the time, Spears told reporters during a press conference in London that she was "not in an intense relationship with anyone at the moment." Later that week, during an appearance on the Big Breakfast talk show, she reiterated her single status: "I'm single… right now."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>What Rewatching Crossroads Reveals About Britney Spears</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her memoir, Spears alleges that Timberlake initiated the breakup while he was making his first solo album, Justified, because he wanted use her "as ammunition for his record." Spears also writes that he broke up with her via text message while she was shooting her music video for a remix of "Overprotected." While he later visited her at her family's home in Louisiana to dissolve their relationship in person, bringing her a letter that he wrote and framed (that Spears says she still has under her bed), the breakup was still devastating, with Spears noting that she cried and could barely speak for months, leading her to wonder if she was "clinically in shock." Timberlake has not commented on Spears' memoir.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">November 2022: Justin addresses their breakup during his media tour for his solo album</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ahead of the release of his first solo album, much of the media around Timberlake focused on his split from Spears. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, Timberlake talked about his "broken heart."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It hurts too bad," he said. "You get to a point when you're crying yourself to sleep every night.

I don't judge anybody. It's just young love...It was a very intense relationship, that's for sure."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">November 2022: Justin's music video for "Cry Me a River" sparks rumors that Spears cheated on him</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Timberlake's second single from Justified, "Cry Me a River," dealt with themes of infidelity, which were echoed in the music video for the song featuring a Spears look-alike.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In her memoir, Spears writes that in the time following the release of the "Cry Me a River" music video, she suffered from awful scrutiny from the news media and from fans, who assumed that the narratives around being cheated on were inspired by her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"In the news media, I was described as a harlot who'd broken the heart of America's golden boy," she writes. "The truth: I was comatose in Louisiana, and he was happily running around Hollywood."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She recalls being booed everywhere she went, from clubs to a Lakers game, where the whole arena booed her. For Spears, the shaming she suffered was especially painful because of his own infidelity. While Spears had cheated on Timberlake just once—making out with her backup dancer Wade Robson—she alleges that he cheated on her several times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"There were a couple of times during our relationship when I knew Justin had cheated on me," she writes.

You did something that caused him so much pain, so much suffering. What did you do?" Sawyer asked, before pressing Spears on whether she had cheated on Timberlake. "He left the impression that you weren't faithful, that you betrayed the relationship."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Spears, for her part, responded neutrally. "I think everyone has a side of their story to make them feel a certain way," she said. "I'm not technically saying he's wrong, but I'm not technically saying he's right either."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">May 2004: Spears releases the music video for "Everytime," which some fans interpret as a response to "Call Me a River"</h2><p></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In May 2004, Spears released the music video for her song, "Everytime," which portrays the end of a high-profile relationship, leading many fans to speculate that it was about her split with Timberlake. Spears says the song, which includes the lyrics: "I may have made it rain / Please, forgive me / My weakness caused you pain / And this song's my sorry," is about the heartbreak of losing your first love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love," she told MTV in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2004 interview.</a> "That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Since<strong> </strong>Spears revealed in her new<strong> </strong>memoir that she had an abortion while dating Timberlake, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans have been speculating</a> that the song is actually about feelings around terminating her pregnancy, pointing to a scene in a hospital where one woman is dying, while another gives birth.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">July 2006: Justin blames Britney for breakup fallout</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ </a>in 2006, Timberlake slammed Spears for how she handled their split publicly, saying that he wrote "Cry Me a River" in two hours as a response.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I felt like she had a couple of opportunities to just sort of stick up for me, and she didn't," he said. "Which is ﬁne. But at that time, you know, I fought back, and that's the way I fought back. I used my mind. I came up with a song."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">February 2021: Justin issues a public apology to Britney</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Two decades after they first began dating, Timberlake released a public apology on social media to Spears, after facing criticism following the release of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Framing Britney Spears, a New York Times documentary</a> that reviewed how the media and relentless scrutiny negatively impacted Spear's personal, public, and business lives. Timberlake also used his statement to apologize to Janet Jackson for the racist and misogynistic narratives and treatment she was subject to after he exposed her breast during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"I've seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak for what was right," Timberlake <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. "I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism," he continued. "I specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed...I have not been perfect in navigating all of this throughout my career. I know this apology is a first step and doesn't absolve the past. I want to take accountability for my own missteps in all of this."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">October 2023: Britney reveals that she had an abortion while she was dating Timberlake</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In The Woman in Me, Spears reveals that she had a medical abortion during her relationship with Timberlake.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">"It was a surprise, but for me, it wasn’t a tragedy. I loved Justin so much. I always expected us to have a family together one day. This would just be much earlier than I’d anticipated,” Spears writes<strong> </strong>of finding out she was pregnant. “But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young. If it had been left up to me alone, I never would have done it. And yet Justin was so sure that he didn’t want to be a father.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2JqhHl8jpupoqyemsZuv8%2BemKurXZ%2FCtMDIp2StoZ2XsrO4wKScZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-justin-timberlake-relationship-timeline.html&text=Britney%20Spears%20and%20Justin%20Timberlake%20Relationship%20Timeline&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-justin-timberlake-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-justin-timberlake-relationship-timeline.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20and%20Justin%20Timberlake%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbritney-spears-justin-timberlake-relationship-timeline.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20and%20Justin%20Timberlake%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-justin-timberlake-relationship-timeline.html&title=Britney%20Spears%20and%20Justin%20Timberlake%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-justin-timberlake-relationship-timeline.html&description=Britney%20Spears%20and%20Justin%20Timberlake%20Relationship%20Timeline" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./finn-wolfhard-praises-noah-schnapp-coming-out-gay-stranger-things-1235509444.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Finn Wolfhard Really Proud of Noah Schnapp for Coming Out as Gay: I Had a Big Smile o">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./90-day-fiance-star-anfisa-nava-is-prepping-for-her-first-bikini-competition.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'90 Day Fiance' Star Anfisa Nava Is Prepping For Her First Bikini Competition">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
