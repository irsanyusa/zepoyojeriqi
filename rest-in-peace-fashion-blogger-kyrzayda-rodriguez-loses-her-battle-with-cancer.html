The radiant fashion blogger first rose to fame with her eclectic and stylish looks. She was sexy, edgy and fun and she blogged about her adventures in the most captivating way.</p><p>Kryzayda had already amassed quite the following when she shocked fans by announcing that she had been <a href=# id=34bb496f-122c-50b4-aa36-64bb9ff77b4d>diagnosed with stomach cancer following some health issues in late 2017</a>. Soon after Kyrzayda was diagnosed and instead of letting the disease defeat her, she remained defiant in the face of diversity and was determined to make sure that her diagnosis didn't stop her zeal for life.</p><p>She blogged throughout her battle, documenting each treatment and each milestone including losing her hair and losing weight. We watched as Kryzayda became a shadow of herself but the smile never left her lips nor the light left her eyes. She was a fantastic example of remaining strong in the face of adversity.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Writing on Kyrzayda's Instagram, her friend <strong>Joanne</strong> confirmed her death:</p><p>You were someone who inspired so many people across the world. Not only were you an icon, you were an amazing daughter, mother and friend.&nbsp;Our hearts are broken to see you go. But we know you are no longer in pain and can now rest.&nbsp;Heaven has gained an Angel!&nbsp;We love you forever! - Joanne&nbsp;8.18.78 - 9.9.18</p><p>Kyrzayda will be very sorely missed and we wish peace and healing upon her friends and family.</p><p>Every single day, we are reminded of the remarkable resilience of some people battling with things we could not even imagine. One such person is&nbsp;<a href=# id=556a4663-ac32-5f29-ba0b-3a1d58c4de5a>fashion and lifestyle blogger</a>Kyrzayda Rodriguez who is currently fighting stage 4 cancer but she's not letting the disease stop her style.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She describes herself as a 37- year old full time mother who loves Jesus and is passionate about fashion and fitness. From the minute she started the blog, it was clear that Kyrzayda had a unique flair for style and amassed quite a following taking her fans along on her life journey.</p><p>Everything took a turn for the worst in late 2017 when Kyrzayda was hospitalised stating she had fluid in her lungs and stomach. Soon after Kyrzayda was diagnosed and instead of letting the disease defeat her, she remained defiant in the face of diversity and is determined to make sure that her diagnosis does not stop her zeal for life.</p><p>Writing on her blog about her diagnosis, Kyrzayda wrote:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Hi Loves!!</p><p>Stopping by to give a HUGE THANK YOU to everyone who has been super supportive to me in this time of need. As you guys know I was recently diagnosed with cancer :(. But wait let’s rewind to a few weeks ago when I was given a different diagnosis (ENDO) but it wasn’t 100%. &nbsp;You guys also supported me by sending me messages and keeping me alert to the symptoms of ENDO.</p><p>My symptoms had nothing to do with ENDO. I took it upon me to go back into the ER my body didn’t feel right. I was super bloated but it wasn’t normal. I know my &nbsp;body and something wasn’t right. I was admitted for having fluids in my lungs and stomach the same night I went into the ER. After being in the hospital for 4 days, and getting some more tests done including a biopsy, the sad news came in. YOU HAVE cancer. Shit … F…K your world changes. Your head spins and you just want to cry to your Mom. I’m doing ok now just waiting for the next process which is CHEMO.</p><p>I’m so thankful this platform allows us to connect and support each other.</p><p>After announcing her health situation the young mother informed her followers that she would be going in for chemotherapy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Whilst her followers didn't expect her to be posting as regularly, Kyrzayda shocked the world by continuing to post about her style, health and current situation as often as possible.</p><p>Fans have followed Kyrzayda's tumultuous journey and watched her not only lose her hair but also lose a significant amount of weight as her harrowing treatment takes its toll.</p><p>Despite it all, Kyrzayda remains effortlessly stylish and optimistic, her positivity and her passion for life is incredibly inspiring and we take a look at the woman who is not letting her diagnosis dim her shine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdnoprAtXnIp2SpnZGYsm6ywKyfoqeeYq%2Btu8agnKtlm66%2Fu63YnZhmqp%2BZv6qz1J6xZqSfqLK0eceeqWaakanBrbGMsKCtoF2Yrq%2BvxKtmcnCmm4V5vw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frest-in-peace-fashion-blogger-kyrzayda-rodriguez-loses-her-battle-with-cancer.html&text=Fashion%20blogger%20Kyrzayda%20Rodriguez%20loses%20her%20battle%20with%20cancer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frest-in-peace-fashion-blogger-kyrzayda-rodriguez-loses-her-battle-with-cancer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frest-in-peace-fashion-blogger-kyrzayda-rodriguez-loses-her-battle-with-cancer.html&title=Fashion%20blogger%20Kyrzayda%20Rodriguez%20loses%20her%20battle%20with%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frest-in-peace-fashion-blogger-kyrzayda-rodriguez-loses-her-battle-with-cancer.html&title=Fashion%20blogger%20Kyrzayda%20Rodriguez%20loses%20her%20battle%20with%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frest-in-peace-fashion-blogger-kyrzayda-rodriguez-loses-her-battle-with-cancer.html&title=Fashion%20blogger%20Kyrzayda%20Rodriguez%20loses%20her%20battle%20with%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frest-in-peace-fashion-blogger-kyrzayda-rodriguez-loses-her-battle-with-cancer.html&description=Fashion%20blogger%20Kyrzayda%20Rodriguez%20loses%20her%20battle%20with%20cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./fruit-flies-california-citrus-climate-change.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fruit Fly Infestation in U.S. Grows Worse With Climate Change">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./comment-les-cantines-scolaires-peuvent-resister-linflation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Comment les cantines scolaires peuvent-elles rsister  l'inflation ?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
